# Hovercraft Velocity Solver
This Java application runs a numerical solver of a Riccati differential equation to solve for the velocity of a hovercraft as a function of time. Computation is facilitated by the Apache Math library; graphing is facilitated by the JFreeChart library (which itself uses JCommon); testing is done using JUnit. Users interact through a basic GUI written in Swing.
