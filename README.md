# Hovercraft Velocity Solver
This Java application runs a numerical solver of a Riccati differential equation to solve for the velocity of a hovercraft as a function of time. Computation is facilitated by the Apache Math library; graphing is facilitated by the JFreeChart library (which itself uses JCommon); testing is done using JUnit. Users interact through a basic GUI written in Swing.

The entire Eclipse project is included for import. Note that because I have Presonus Studio One installed on my computer, the Eclipse .project file has a Studio One .project thumbnail. This shouldn't affect the functionality, as long as you do not rename the file.
